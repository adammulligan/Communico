# Communico

A ShareJS server for sharing notes among computers in a local network.
Used as an always on replacement for IRC/IM/etc. that doesn't require
the persistence or starting costs of conversations.

## Starting the Server

* `node app.js` starts the server on `http://localhost:8000`.

The `-p` flag allows you to set the port to bind to:

* `node app.js -p 1234`
